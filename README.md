Github Repository for SimpliHacks 2.0 2022 Plantverse

The Plantverse app is an idle farming app in which users can 
plant and grow their own virtual garden. Once planted, the plants 
will automatically produce currency, which the user can use to 
buy more plants and level the current ones up. The currency can 
also be spent in the plant collecting gacha, an added feature 
that engages the user in an exciting mystery plant collecting game. 
Information on the plants that are collected and grown by the user 
can be found in the Plant Library, a database of information and 
photographs on common but also exotic global plants. This database 
also includes external resources for the user to learn what they 
can do to protect endangered species and guides on how to grow plants 
of their own in real life. Over time, the user would grow and expand 
their virtual garden, learn more about different species of plants, 
and act to protect the environment in real life.



To try out our project, please see the Axure link in our devpost.
We also used javascript framework to code our project in Axure, however,
Axure does not seem to have the option to export said code.
